# VA FileMan Data Extraction and Automation

## Overview

VA FileMan is the database management system for the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment. It enables the creation and maintenance of databases within VistA, allowing users to manage healthcare-related information efficiently.

## Data Extraction from VistA FileMan

Extracting data from VA FileMan involves querying the system to retrieve relevant healthcare records. The extraction process typically follows these steps:

1. **Connect to VistA** - Establish a secure connection to the VistA system.
2. **Run Queries** - Use VA FileMan's built-in query tools to extract structured data.
3. **Export Data** - Save the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, xlsx, .

## Parsing Extracted Data

Once the data is extracted, it needs to be parsed and processed for further use. This includes validating formats, cleaning inconsistencies, and transforming the data for storage.

## Automating Data Extraction Using Paramiko

To automate the data extraction process, we can use **Paramiko**, a Python library for SSH connections. This allows us to securely connect to the VistA system and automate data retrieval.

## Storing Data in an SQL Database

After extracting and parsing the data, it can be stored in an SQL database for further analysis and retrieval.
