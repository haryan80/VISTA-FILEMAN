VA FileMan Data Extraction and Automation

Overview

VA FileMan is the database management system for the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment. It enables the creation and maintenance of databases within VistA, allowing users to manage healthcare-related information efficiently.

Data Extraction from VistA FileMan

Extracting data from VA FileMan involves querying the system to retrieve relevant healthcare records. The extraction process typically follows these steps:

Connect to VistA - Establish a secure connection to the VistA system.

Run Queries - Use VA FileMan's built-in query tools to extract structured data.

Export Data - Save the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, xlsx, .

Parsing Extracted Data

Once the data is extracted, it needs to be parsed and processed for further use. This includes validating formats, cleaning inconsistencies, and transforming the data for storage.

Automating Data Extraction Using Paramiko

To automate the data extraction process, we can use Paramiko, a Python library for SSH connections. This allows us to securely connect to the VistA system and automate data retrieval.

Storing Data in an SQL Database

After extracting and parsing the data, it can be stored in an SQL database for further analysis and retrieval.entials for VISTA.
- `optimus_prime`, `optimus_random`: Parameters for data encoding.

Update the following constant with the path to the Excel file used for setting up FileMan:
- `FILEMAN_SETTING_FILE_PATH`: Path to the `fileman_vitals_conditions.xlsx` file.

## Functions

### `establish_connection()`
Establishes a connection to the SQL Server using `pyodbc`.

### `get_max_value_from_db(conn)`
Retrieves the maximum value from the `NUMBER` column in the `VISTA_VITALS` table.

### `update_excel_with_max_value(file_path, max_value)`
Updates the specified Excel file with the maximum value retrieved from the database.

### `generate_fileman_string(df)`
Generates a search string for FileMan based on the updated Excel file.

### `setup_ssh_connection(host, username, password, port=22)`
Sets up an SSH connection to the FileMan server.

### `extract_data()`
Main function that orchestrates the data extraction process. It connects to the database, retrieves data, and performs SSH operations.

### `close_connection(conn)`
Closes the database connection.

### `parse_file(filename, conn)`
Parses the output file generated by FileMan and inserts the data into the database.

### `insert_data_batch(conn, data_list, columns)`
Inserts data into the database in batches.

### `main_function()`
Main loop function that runs the data extraction and parsing processes. It handles retries in case of errors and loops indefinitely, with a 12-hour wait between iterations.

## Usage
The script is designed to be run continuously in an environment where data needs to be extracted and processed regularly. It handles errors gracefully and retries operations after a brief pause. The script will loop indefinitely, processing data every 12 hours.


Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your script file.

## Notes
- Ensure that all required credentials and paths are correctly set in the script before execution.
- If an error occurs, the script will wait 5 minutes before retrying the operation.

This documentation should help the client understand the script's purpose, how to configure it, and how to run it. Let me know if you need any additional information or modifications!
