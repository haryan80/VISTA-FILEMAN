# Data Extraction and Processing Script

## Overview
This script is designed to extract vital signs data from a SQL Server database, process it, and then insert the parsed data into another database. The script involves establishing database and SSH connections, handling large amounts of data, and performing batch inserts into the database.

## Prerequisites
The script requires the following Python libraries:
- `os`
- `time`
- `warnings`
- `pyodbc`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `tqdm`
- `paramiko`
- `datetime`
- `IPython.display`

Install these libraries using `pip` if they are not already installed:
```bash
pip install pyodbc pandas numpy tqdm paramiko ipython
```

## Constants
The script defines several constants, which should be updated with your environment-specific values:
- `SERVER_NAME`: Name of the SQL Server.
- `DATABASE`: Name of the database.
- `UID`: Database username.
- `PWD`: Database password.
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of records to process in each batch.
- `FILEMAN_IP`, `FILEMAN_USER`, `FILEMAN_PASSWORD`: SSH credentials for FileMan.
- `VISTA_USERNAME`, `VISTA_PASSWORD`: Credentials for VISTA.
- `optimus_prime`, `optimus_random`: Parameters for data encoding.

Update the following constant with the path to the Excel file used for setting up FileMan:
- `FILEMAN_SETTING_FILE_PATH`: Path to the `fileman_vitals_conditions.xlsx` file.

## Functions

### `establish_connection()`
Establishes a connection to the SQL Server using `pyodbc`.

### `get_max_value_from_db(conn)`
Retrieves the maximum value from the `NUMBER` column in the `VISTA_VITALS` table.

### `update_excel_with_max_value(file_path, max_value)`
Updates the specified Excel file with the maximum value retrieved from the database.

### `generate_fileman_string(df)`
Generates a search string for FileMan based on the updated Excel file.

### `setup_ssh_connection(host, username, password, port=22)`
Sets up an SSH connection to the FileMan server.

### `extract_data()`
Main function that orchestrates the data extraction process. It connects to the database, retrieves data, and performs SSH operations.

### `close_connection(conn)`
Closes the database connection.

### `parse_file(filename, conn)`
Parses the output file generated by FileMan and inserts the data into the database.

### `insert_data_batch(conn, data_list, columns)`
Inserts data into the database in batches.

### `main_function()`
Main loop function that runs the data extraction and parsing processes. It handles retries in case of errors and loops indefinitely, with a 12-hour wait between iterations.

## Usage
The script is designed to be run continuously in an environment where data needs to be extracted and processed regularly. It handles errors gracefully and retries operations after a brief pause. The script will loop indefinitely, processing data every 12 hours.



## Notes
- Ensure that all required credentials and paths are correctly set in the script before execution.
- The script logs SSH operations to `patient_vitals.log`.
- If an error occurs, the script will wait 5 minutes before retrying the operation.
